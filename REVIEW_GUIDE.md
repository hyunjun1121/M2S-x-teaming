## üéØ Review Focus Areas

Dear Reviewers, we recommend focusing on the following aspects of our submission:

### 1. **Algorithmic Innovation**
- **Evolution Algorithm**: `agents/evolutionary_m2s_generator.py`
- **Template Generation**: Automated M2S template creation and optimization
- **Selection Pressure**: Tournament selection with threshold-based fitness

### 2. **Experimental Rigor**
- **Statistical Framework**: StrongReject evaluation with Wilson confidence intervals
- **Multi-Model Testing**: 5 SOTA models across different organizations
- **Balanced Sampling**: 2,500 experiments with controlled group distribution

### 3. **Key Claims Verification**

#### Claim 1: Evolution Improves Template Performance
- **Evidence**: `evolution_results/2025-09-08_19-06-08/m2s_evolution_analysis.json`
- **Metric**: evolved_template_1 achieves 36.6% vs 36.0% (best baseline)
- **Verification**: Check generation-by-generation performance improvements

#### Claim 2: Model-Specific Vulnerability Patterns  
- **Evidence**: `evaluation_results/multi_model_evaluation_2025-09-09/success_rate_matrix.csv`
- **Key Finding**: GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro show complete immunity (0% success)
- **Verification**: Review per-model performance statistics

#### Claim 3: Statistical Significance of Improvements
- **Evidence**: `evaluation_results/multi_model_evaluation_2025-09-09/summary_statistics.json`
- **Statistical Tests**: Wilson CIs, Cohen's d effect sizes
- **Verification**: GPT-4.1 shows +6.9% improvement (Cohen's d = +2.109)

## üîç Verification Checklist

### **Reproducibility Assessment**
- [ ] Environment setup instructions are complete (`scripts/setup_simple_env.sh`)
- [ ] All dependencies are specified (`scripts/requirements*.txt`)  
- [ ] Configuration files are properly documented (`config/`)
- [ ] Example execution scripts are provided (`examples/`)

### **Statistical Validity**
- [ ] Sample sizes are adequate (100 per model-template pair)
- [ ] Balanced experimental design across dataset groups
- [ ] Appropriate statistical tests (Wilson CIs for binomial data)
- [ ] Effect sizes reported alongside p-values

### **Result Consistency**
- [ ] Results match between different files (matrix vs JSON)
- [ ] Figures accurately represent underlying data
- [ ] Statistical analysis conclusions are supported by data

## üö® Known Limitations (Acknowledged)

1. **Limited Statistical Power**: Small sample sizes per template-model group
2. **Model Version Dependency**: Results specific to tested model versions  
3. **API Variability**: Some variance expected due to API randomness
4. **Threshold Sensitivity**: Results depend on StrongReject threshold (0.70)

## üí¨ Questions for Authors (Anonymous)

Common reviewer questions we anticipate:

### **Technical Questions**
1. How sensitive are results to hyperparameter choices?
2. What is the computational cost of the evolution process?
3. How do results generalize to other M2S baseline templates?

### **Methodological Questions**
1. Why was threshold=0.70 chosen for the evolution process?
2. How were model API parameters (temperature, etc.) controlled?
3. What measures were taken to ensure reproducible sampling?

### **Broader Impact Questions**
1. What are the implications for AI safety research?
2. How should these findings inform defensive strategies?
3. What ethical considerations guided this research?
