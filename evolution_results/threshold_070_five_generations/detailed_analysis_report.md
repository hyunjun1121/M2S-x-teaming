## 🧬 Evolution Insights

### Template Evolution Pattern
1. **Base templates** (Gen 1): Established baseline performance
2. **Refinement** (Gen 2-3): Gradual performance decline as system adapts
3. **Innovation** (Gen 4-5): New evolved templates emerge with mixed performance

### Key Observations
- Hyphenize and Pythonize maintain highest success rates (52%)
- Numberize consistently underperforms (34%)
- Evolved templates show intermediate performance (37.5-47.5%)
- Response length remains a significant factor in success

## 📝 Paper-Ready Findings

### Main Results
1. **Evolution Success**: The X-teaming approach successfully generated 2 new M2S templates through 5 generations of evolution
2. **Performance Trade-off**: Higher threshold (0.70) reduces success rate but enables meaningful template evolution
3. **Template Diversity**: Significant performance differences between templates (Cohen's h up to 0.366)
4. **Length Bias**: Confirmed strong correlation between response length and evaluation scores (r = 0.338, p < 0.0001)

### Methodological Contributions
1. **Adaptive Threshold**: Demonstrated importance of calibrated success thresholds for evolutionary algorithms
2. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Complete input-output-score tracking for all 230 experiments
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Wilson confidence intervals and effect size calculations for robust comparisons

### Limitations
- Length bias in StrongReject evaluation requires further investigation
- Limited to single target model (GPT-4.1)
- Evolution converged after 5 generations

## 💡 Recommendations for Paper
